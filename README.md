# Commerce_Back_End

Hello and welcome to the E-Commerce Back end, this backend allows for API requests to be made to specific routes that'll allow for the creation, updating and deleting of different categories, products, and tags for any item. Something like this could be the backbone for an ecommerce website. This application uses sequelize to work with the sql databases to manage columns and information.
